/*Trading API Methods

To use the trading API, you will need to create an API key.

All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP POST to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain the following headers:

    Key - Your API key.
    Sign - The query's POST data signed by your key's "secret" according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.

Additionally, all queries must include a "nonce" POST parameter. The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater than the previous nonce used.

All responses from the trading API are in JSON format. In the event of an error, the response will always be of the following format:

{"error":"<error message>"}

There are several methods accepted by the trading API, each of which is specified by the "command" POST parameter:*/
